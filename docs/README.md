# High Level Requirements

The Stable Seas project was conceived of to discern patterns in maritime security by mapping and measuring key indicators across space and over time. The goal is to inform actions to be taken to improve the security situation for people at sea and ashore.

In order to create a compelling and useful report for our stakeholders, the team has designed and developed an interactive geographic data visualization as a website. The aim of this project was to provide users with an intuitive resource that could communicate meaning in a glance while providing access to underlying data and methods, and publications cited.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Contributors to this fairly complex project can be broken up into a few bins: the management team, the research team, and the product team.

### Management team

The management set strategy and direction and manages project management systems to coordinate the research and product teams. They also developed the quantitative indices that are visualized in the report.

### Research team

A multidisciplinary research team synthesized numerous reports, studies and articles and created the written Stable Seas report included in the website's content cards.

### Product team

The product team designed and developed the Stable Seas website, incorporating the quantitative and qualitative report information created by the rest of the team.

## Team goals and business objectives

In creating the Stable Seas report the team intended to position One Earth Future as an expert resource to maritime actors with a stake in the African maritime space. Various metrics could be used to measure success in achieving impact - website indicators such as page views, bounce rate, etc, and others including media enquiries, invitations for briefings, etc. Impact could be achieved by affecting policymaking, improving stakeholder coordination, changing human behavior, and any number of other ways, as determined by OEF leadership. This tool is meant to support those efforts.

## Strategic fit

The maritime space is one of the least governed on earth. This enables illicit actors to operate with much impunity, contributing both directly and indirectly to drivers of organized political violence around the world. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of maritime security issues will enable policy makers and other stakeholders to create inclusive and resilient policies and responses to insecurity and harm, thereby reducing the prevalence of violence on and related to the sea.
